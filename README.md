# Fintecture

Fintecture is a licensed and one-stop shop gateway to Open Banking.

Our APIs allow easy and secure access to bank account data and payment initiation. The account data accessible are account holder's personal information, account balances, transaction history and much more. The available payment methods depend on the banks implementation but typically are domestic transfers, SEPA credit transfer, instant SEPA credit transfer, fast payment scheme, and SWIFT international payments.

Fintecture APIs enable to connect to both Production and Sandbox environments of banks. Our Sandbox has the particularity of being connected to other banks' Sandbox. This will give you a flavour of what you can expect in production in terms of user experience and data sets.

## Installation

```javascript
npm install 'fintecture-client'
```

## Usage

The SDK enables multiple use cases. Essentially, it runs down to whether you want / need to go through our bank selection module "Fintecture Connect" ( which is mandatory if you're not an Agent or a licensed TPP. )

This section is divided based on the following use cases:

- First Steps
- Use Cases
  - AIS without Connect
  - AIS with Connect
  - PIS without Connect
  - PIS with Connect

### First Steps

Independantly of the use case, the first step is to create a developer account on the [Fintecture Console](https://console.fintecture.com/auth/register) and create an application to get your **app_id**, **app_secret** and **private_key**.

You are now ready to start coding. Next step is
import the Fintecture Client library and instantiate the client object:

```javascript
const { FintectureClient } = require('fintecture-client');

let client = new FintectureClient({ 
        app_id: process.env.APP_ID
        ,app_secret: process.env.APP_SECRET
        ,private_key: process.env.APP_PRIV_KEY
        ,env: process.env.FINTECTURE_ENV 
        });

```

### Use Cases

#### AIS without Connect

To access the PSU's account information, you have to go through the following steps:

1. Select a Bank

```javascript
let options = {'filter[ais]': 'accounts', 'filter[country]': 'FR', 'filter[psu_supported_types]': 'retail', 'sort[full_name]': 'asc'}
let providers = await client.getProviders(options);
```

2. Get the bank's authentication URL and redirect your PSU to his bank

```javascript
let providerAuth = await client.getProviderAuthUrl(null, providerId, redirectUri, state);
windows.href.location = providerAuth.url;
```

3. Authenticate your app to Fintecture and get your **access_token** and **refresh_token**

```javascript
let tokens = await client.getAccessToken(code);
```

4. Request any AIS API

```javascript
let accounts = await client.getAccounts(accessToken, customerId);

let account accounts.data[0].id
let transactions = await client.getTransactions(accessToken, customerId, account);
```


> Note that the **code** and **customer_id** are returned as query parameters when the PSU is redirected back to your environment.

#### AIS with Connect

> Soon available

#### PIS without Connect

The initiate a payment on behalf of a PSU, you have to go through the following steps:

1. Select a Bank

```javascript
let options = {'filter[pis]': 'SEPA', 'filter[country]': 'FR', 'filter[psu_supported_types]': 'retail', 'sort[full_name]': 'asc'}
let providers = await client.getProviders(options);
```

2. Authenticate your app to Fintecture and get your **access_token**

```javascript
let token = await client.getAccessToken();
```

3. Initiate a payment

```javascript
let payment = {
            data: {
                type: "PIS",
                attributes: {
                    amount: 1,
                    currency: "EUR",
                    communication: "Thanks Mom!",
                    beneficiary : {
                        name : "Bob Smith",
                        address : "8 road of somewhere, 80330 Lisboa",
                        country : "ES",
                        iban : "PT07BARC20325388680799",
                        swift_bic: "DEUTPTFF"
                    }
                }
            }
        }

let response = await client.paymentInitiate(accessToken, providerId, payment, redirectUri, state);
```


#### PIS with Connect

```javascript
let connectConfig = {
    amount: 125,
    currency: 'EUR',

    customer_id: '9',
    customer_full_name: 'Bob Smith',
    customer_email: 'bob.smith@gmail.com',
    customer_ip: '127.0.0.1',
    redirect_uri: 'https://www.mywebsite.com/callback',
    origin_uri: 'https://www.mywebsite.com/shop/checkout',
    state: 'somestate'
